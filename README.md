## üìò Overview  

This project demonstrates the **design, implementation, and testing of a smart office network** integrating both traditional office devices and IoT systems.  
It was **independently planned, designed, and tested** to showcase practical understanding of modern smart office infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer.  

The network supports **wired and wireless communication**, employs **static and dynamic IP configurations**, and enables IoT device management through a dedicated **IoT Server and mobile application**.  
An additional **satellite office** network was designed to demonstrate scalability, subnetting, and automation capabilities.

## üéØ Objectives  

- Design and implement a smart office network for eight staff members with IoT integration.  
- Extend the design to a satellite office with a separate subnet.  
- Validate connectivity using **PING**, **TRACERT**, and **PDU** tests.  
- Develop a **user-friendly Packet Tracer guide** for training and documentation.
